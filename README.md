This is a collection of JSON files that are a conversion from the Johns Hopkins CSSE [csv files located here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/).
This collects the data from the each of the rows in both the confirmed and deaths statistics and puts them in their respective cities. The json files are also organized by city and state where state is the folder name and the city is the filename.

The tool to convert this data is written in the Rust and will be open sourced soon.

This is a work in progress and will be updated as frequently as possible.
